name = "Auto Switch Slot & Re-Equip Client Mod"
description =
[[
This client side mod works when joining other servers or hosting your own DST server with caves. Equipping another item from your inventory or backpack via keyboard shortcuts/right clicks will now automatically switch its "saved slot" with the one you were previously wearing.

Extra weapons will now also auto re-equip (or reload for projectiles) upon breaking/running out of ammo.

Latest Patch Notes:
v1.3 : Now compatible with cave-less worlds & Don't Starve Alone mod
v1.3a: Minor fix - equips on load are now initialized in cave-less & DSA.
