# Proper Switching & Auto Re-Equip

This mod is created for Don't Starve Together and can be found in the [Steam Workshop here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2841310635).

It automatically does two things: re-equipping extra weapons when broken/out of ammo and correcting equipped prevslots when needed.
