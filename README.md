# Auto Switch Slot & Re-Equip

This mod is created for Don't Starve Together.

It makes equipping another item from your inventory or backpack via keyboard shortcuts/right clicks automatically switch its "saved slot" with the one you were previously wearing.

It also makes extra weapons auto re-equip (or reload for projectiles) upon breaking/running out of ammo.
